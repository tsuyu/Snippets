Suppose your ntfs filesystem is /dev/sda1 and you are going to mount it on /mymnt/win, do the following. 

First, create a mount point. 
mkdir /mymnt/win 

Next, edit /etc/fstab as follows. To mount read-only: 
/dev/sda1       /mymnt/win   ntfs-3g  ro,umask=0222,defaults 0 0 

To mount read-write: 
/dev/sda1       /mymnt/win   ntfs-3g  rw,umask=0000,defaults 0 0 

You can now mount it by running: 
mount /mymnt/win
