Oracle form Controls Tab Index Issue

In the forms, under Data Blocks ---> <datablock_name> ---> Items all the items will be listed.

Change the order of those items as per your required tab order (First item on top). Then when you run the form it will be OK.

Or else you can set the properties PREVIOUS NAVIGATION ITEM, NEXT NAVIGATION ITEM of each item for the tab order.
