[Oracle] Resetting a sequence


To reset a sequence SEQ created through the command:
CREATE SEQUENCE seq; 
Search for its current value via the command:
SEQ.CURRVAL SELECT FROM DUAL; 
Then change the sequence by adding the option by adding increment value VAL(current value - 1) to reset the sequence to 1:
ALTER SEQUENCE SEQ INCREMENT by -VAL; 
Then run the command that will reset the sequence:
SEQ.NEXTVAL SELECT FROM DUAL; 
To restore the increment of the sequence:
ALTER SEQUENCE SEQ INCREMENT by 1; 



Example: 

SQL> create sequence seq;   

Sequence created.   

SQL> select seq.nextval from dual;   

   NEXTVAL  
----------  
         1  

SQL> select seq.nextval from dual;  

   NEXTVAL  
----------  
         2  

SQL> select seq.nextval from dual;  

   NEXTVAL  
----------  
         3  

SQL> select seq.currval from dual;   

    CURRVAL   
----------   
          3   
SQL> alter sequence seq increment by -2;  // 2=SEQ.CURRVAL-1  

Sequence altered.   

SQL> select seq.nextval from dual;   

    NEXTVAL  
----------   
          1   

SQL> alter sequence seq increment by 1;   

Sequence altered.
