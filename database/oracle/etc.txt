     FROM dba_data_files
     GROUP BY tablespace_name)
  USING (tablespace_name)
LEFT OUTER JOIN
  (SELECT tablespace_name, sum(bytes) AS used_bytes
     from dba_segments

LEFT OUTER JOIN
  (SELECT tablespace_name, SUM(bytes) AS free_bytes
     FROM dba_free_space
     GROUP BY tablespace_name)

* table space properties

SELECT TABLESPACE_NAME, FILE_NAME, FILE_ID
FROM DBA_DATA_FILES
WHERE TABLESPACE_NAME = 'MYDATA';

* drop tablespace

DROP TABLESPACE <tablespace name> INCLUDING CONTENTS;

* find out which accounts are expired
select username, account_status from dba_users where ACCOUNT_STATUS LIKE '%EXPIRED%';

* unexpire an account
once an account has been expired, it can only be revived by assigning it a new password:
ALTER USER scott IDENTIFIED BY password;

* unlock an account
ALTER USER scott ACCOUNT UNLOCK;

* disable default password expiry [2]
this all depends on the profile a user belongs to, to disable password expiry for all users assigned the default user profile do this:
ALTER PROFILE DEFAULT LIMIT PASSWORD_LIFE_TIME UNLIMITED;
